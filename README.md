# **FlavourPalette**

**Technologies**: Django, Python, React, PostgreSQL  
**Time Frame**: 10 days  
**Project Type**: Solo Project  

## **Project Overview**
FlavourPalette is my take on the perfect recipe management app, built to help users showcase their culinary creations and explore new dishes. With secure authentication and personalized profiles, users can easily create, update, and organize their own recipes while enjoying a browsing experience that's uniquely tailored to them. This project reflects my passion for combining both front-end and back-end development, integrating multiple technologies to create a smooth, intuitive platform that brings out the joy of cooking for everyone.

The application is divided into two main components:
1. **Frontend**: Built using React, this component offers a dynamic user interface for viewing and interacting with recipes.
2. **Backend**: Implemented using Django and Python, it provides robust data management and secure authentication.
